# DYSECTOR Shop Prototype - Progress

## Current Version: v6

---

## Session 6 - Dec 11, 2024

### What We Built

**Full Gameplay Loop Complete**
- SERVICE → REPAIR → PICKUP loop now fully functional
- Pickup customers spawn for completed jobs with "P" intent marker
- Remaining payment collected on pickup, job moves to completed history
- Reputation bonus (+0.15) on successful pickup

**NPC System Improvements**
- Fixed oscillation bug (NPCs getting stuck moving back/forth) with sidestep memory
- Fixed shelf/display item removal - items now removed when NPC picks them up, not at checkout
- Added `returnItemToInventory()` for NPCs that leave without buying
- Silent flag for NPCs that leave immediately (no browse spots) - no false door chimes
- BUY customers properly browse → pick item → go to counter → pay → leave

**Service Interface UX Overhaul**
- Auto-selects recommended deadline based on urgency and job type
- Randomized threshold (2-3 jobs per day) before moving to next day
- Market rate now displayed in cyan (was hard-to-read grey)
- Shows "DUE: [date] (X days)" for clarity
- Removed "PROTOTYPE" text from canvas

**Problem Types Expansion**
- Added 4 new workbench problem types: Overheating (dust), Driver Issues, Failed Updates, Slow Boot
- Weighted generation: 60% workbench, 40% dive (was heavily skewed to dives)
- Minigame mapping: each problem type maps to specific minigame (dust→pipes, driver→memory, etc.)

**Calendar Improvements**
- Job count display changed from "2J" to "🔧2" for clarity
- Dive summary popup now properly closeable (fixed button styling)
- Days spread jobs across calendar (2-3 per day before moving to next)

**Economy Balance**
- Starting cash lowered to $1,500
- License purchase simplified for prototype (auto-pass test if player has bits)
- Quick stock now randomizes items and quantities (2-7 per slot, 95-110% price variance)

**Hex Pipes Minigame Rewrite**
- Complete rewrite with BFS pathfinding for guaranteed solvable puzzles
- Randomized start/end positions (was always same spots)
- Still needs game design work to be "fun" - mechanically works but needs iteration

### Files Changed
- `js/npcSystem.js` - PICKUP intent, sidestep memory, silent flag, item removal fix
- `js/shop.js` - checkForPickups(), triggerPickupDialogue(), spawn rate boost, silent check
- `js/shopMap.js` - PICKUP intent handling, intent letter display
- `js/serviceInterface.js` - auto-select deadline, improved display, randomized threshold
- `js/gameState.js` - new problem types, weighted selection, starting cash
- `js/probe.js` - minigame mapping, pipe game BFS rewrite
- `js/calendar.js` - job count display, dive popup fix
- `js/inventorySystem.js` - quickStockAll randomization
- `js/shopOS.js` - license purchase simplification

### What's Working Now
- **Complete shop loop**: Customer → Negotiate → Job → Calendar → Repair (Dive/Workbench) → Pickup → Payment
- Balanced problem type distribution (more workbench jobs)
- Service interface requires minimal clicks (auto-selects smart defaults)
- NPC movement smooth without oscillation
- Inventory properly depletes when customers buy

### Known Issues / Future Work
- Minigames need game design iteration to be engaging (pipes especially)
- Minigame-to-problem mapping works but games need fun factor

## Session 5 - Dec 11, 2024

### What We Built

**Probe Minigames (Complete)**
- 4 fully functional minigames for workbench repairs:
  - **Memory Match** - Card matching with preview phase (shows all cards first, then flips)
  - **Probe Launch** - Peggle-style with pegs, breakable walls (HP system), obstacles, aim-then-fire
  - **Hex Pipes** - Rotate tiles to connect path, CONNECT button to verify (limited attempts)
  - **Packet Hunt** - Two-phase (detect anomaly, then hunt all), lives system (wrong clicks cost lives)
- Difficulty scales with device grade (E/C=easy, B=medium, A=hard)
- Job list in sidebar shows pending workbench repairs with deadline colors
- Click job → random game starts → win = job complete + bits

**Calendar → Probe Connection**
- Calendar job popup now enforces repair method:
  - **needsDive: true** (Virus, Corruption, Crashes, Recovery) → Dive only button
  - **needsDive: false** (Slowdown, Cleanup) → Workbench (highlighted) + Dive as "overkill"
- Workbench button switches to Probe tab and auto-starts the job

**License System Overhaul**
- Split into two steps:
  1. **Dive OS Tests** - Pay BITS to take skill test (5k/15k/50k)
  2. **Shop OS Licenses** - Pay CASH to purchase license (1.5k/4k/10k)
- `GameState.testsPassed` tracks passed tests
- Dive OS shows PASSED ✓ when test complete
- Shop OS shows "NEED TEST" until test passed, then allows cash purchase
- Both UIs stay in sync

**Shop OS: Hire Staff (Placeholder)**
- New icon added to Shop OS
- Placeholder content explaining future staff system:
  - Counter Staff - handle sales
  - Repair Tech - workbench jobs
  - Diver - send on dives (lower success rate than player)

### Files Changed
- `js/probe.js` - Complete rewrite with 4 games + job system
- `js/calendar.js` - Job popup enforces dive/workbench, connects to Probe
- `js/diveOS.js` - License tests set testsPassed flag, updateTestCards()
- `js/shopOS.js` - Licenses check testsPassed, Hire app added
- `js/gameState.js` - Added testsPassed object
- `index.html` - Probe tab HTML, Hire icon, test costs updated
- `css/probe.css` - Job list styling

### What's Working Now
- Full repair loop: Customer → Job → Calendar → Workbench/Dive → Complete → Payment
- Probe minigames properly gate workbench repairs
- License progression requires both bits (test) and cash (purchase)
- All 5 tabs functional with interconnected systems

## Session 4 - Dec 10, 2024

### What We Built
- **Shelf/Display Table Stocking System**
  - 20 inventory items with costPrice + marketPrice
  - Backstock storage, shelves (3 slots, 10 per slot), display tables (single item, max 5)
  - Player sets prices with +10%/+20%/+30% quick buttons (based on market price)
  - Profit display shows margin vs cost

- **NPC Shelf/Table Browsing**
  - BUY intent NPCs browse shelves and display tables
  - Random price tolerance (5-35% over market) per customer
  - High markup = fewer sales, low markup = more volume

- **Service Pricing Overhaul (MAJOR)**
  - Player diagnoses device and sets repair price (not customer)
  - Market rate calculated from: problem type × device grade × needsDive
  - Customer reacts based on urgency (desperate pays 140-170%, flexible 90-110%)
  - Negotiation: MAKE QUOTE → accept/counter → ACCEPT/HOLD FIRM
  - **Half down payment** on job acceptance - enables buying supplies before completion

- **Canvas UI Buttons**
  - PAUSE button (green/red) - stops time and NPC movement
  - Q.STOCK button - quick fills all shelves/tables with random items/prices (testing)
  - Version number display (bottom left)

- **Calendar Improvements**
  - Shows job count (3J) and bill charges ($150) on each day
  - Warning pulse animation when jobs + bills overlap
  - Bills show with gold accent, jobs show with red accent

### What's Working
- Full sales loop: backstock → stock shelves → set prices → NPCs browse → check prices → buy or leave → POS register
- Full service loop: customer arrives → diagnose → quote price → negotiate → down payment → job scheduled
- Pause for real-life breaks
- Quick stock for rapid testing
- Calendar shows upcoming financial pressure at a glance

### Version History
- v0.1 - Initial prototype with full shop loop

---

## Session 3 - Dec 10, 2024

### What We Built
- **Dialogue JSON externalization** - 3 files with ~350 lines each, ~30 getter methods
- **Register mini-game** - Bills ($20/10/5/1) + coins (25¢/10¢/5¢/1¢), wrong change = rep hit
- **Service interface** - 14-day calendar for deadline selection
- **NPC intent system** - ? shows until they decide, then S or B reveals intent

### Bug Fixes
- SERVICE_WAIT/POS_WAIT tiles now walkable
- NPC stuck detection with emergency teleport
- Door spawn position fixed (y+1)
- Proper cleanup after serving customers

---

## Session 2 - Dec 10, 2024

### What We Built
- **SaveSystem** - localStorage persistence, version migration
- **ShopGenerator** - Seeded proc-gen layouts, dual counters
- **NPCSystem** - Intent-based routing, state machine, patience decay
- **ShopMap** - Canvas renderer with click handling

---

## Session 1 - Dec 10, 2024

### What We Built
- **Full tabbed interface** matching design doc aesthetic
  - SHOP - text adventure customer interactions
  - SHOP OS - business PC (supplier, licenses, bills, reviews, Null_Sector)
  - DIVE OS - avatar loadout, bits shop, weapons, mods, license tests
  - CALENDAR - week view with deadlines and bills
  - PROBE - placeholder for mini-games later

- **Complete day/time system**
  - Morning phase (frozen) → Open phase (clock runs ~7-8 min) → Closed phase (frozen)
  - Auto-close at 9PM
  - Based on Supermarket Simulator / TCG Card Shop Sim timing

- **Fatigue system**
  - Builds with actions (diving costs 25, failed dive 35, etc.)
  - Levels: Rested → Fine → Tired → Exhausted → Critical
  - Collapse at 100 forces sleep
  - Limits how much you can do after shop closes

- **Customer negotiation system**
  - Random customer generation with names, devices, problems
  - Urgency types affect behavior (desperate pays more, flexible wants discount)
  - Deadline negotiation (accept, counter, rush offer, decline)
  - Jobs tracked with deadlines on calendar

- **Simulated dive system**
  - Success chance based on device grade + health
  - Awards bits (20-80 + bonus), chance for software loot
  - Device health drops during dive
  - Failed dives = more fatigue, less rewards

### What's Working
- Full day loop: wake → morning prep → open shop → customers → close → dive → sleep → repeat
- Two economies (cash vs bits) separated correctly
- Time runs during open hours, customers spawn randomly
- Can negotiate with customers, take jobs, track deadlines
- Can dive into devices on workbench, get results
- Fatigue builds and limits actions

### Next Session - TODO
1. **Probe mini-games** - Star Fox 2D side-scroller for workbench (scan, clean, recover, defrag, bypass)
2. **Device selection for diving** - Currently auto-picks, should let player choose
3. **Workbench scanning** - Implement scan action at workbench (costs fatigue, reveals problems)
4. **Job completion flow** - Complete jobs when device fixed, get paid, reviews
5. **More customer variety** - Different customer types, repeat customers
6. **Weekend handling** - Shop closed Sat/Sun per design doc
7. **Staff system** - Hire workers with their own dive charges
8. **Software packaging** - Cases system for selling found software

### Design Questions to Test
- Is 7-8 min per day right? Too fast? Too slow?
- Does fatigue feel limiting or frustrating?
- Is customer spawn rate good?
- Does negotiation have enough depth?

### Notes
- Kept it vanilla JS - no framework needed for this scope
- Workbench repairs will use probe mini-games, not just dice rolls
- Real dive combat exists in Godot - this is just shop loop testing
